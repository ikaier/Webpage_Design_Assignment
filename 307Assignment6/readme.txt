The page works well on both Chrome and Safari.
Need internet access to get online css resource
The techniques I used from the youtube video:
1. RAM(repeat,auto minmax) from 12:31
I used it on the footer, the when the browser gets smaller, the three parts of link will rearrange to be in a vertical column.

2.The Deconstructed Pancake from 4:10
I didn't use the exactly same style in the video, but I learned the idea of flex box and used it on the main content and footer.


The techniques I used from the Week 6 lecture:
1. Veiwport
I used in the banner of the page, so when the browser gets smaller, the font of "Blogs ..." will get smaller at same time with same rates.

2&3 .Media query & JS Nav Bar
I used both techniques to hide the menu buttons and right side area when the window get smaller. And use nav buttons to bring them back when is needed.

4.Percentage
I used a lot of percentage in width attribute so the whole structure stays same when the browser resize.
